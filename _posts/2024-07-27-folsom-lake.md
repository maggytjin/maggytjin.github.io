One of my favorite car camping locations is Folsom Lake at Beal’s Point. They have great sites with shade, a beach, a bike path, and so much more. We’ve been going yearly since 2021 and planning to go back for the second time this year.

Our first two years, we brought our bikes. The American River Bike Trail starts at Beal’s Point and goes for 32 miles through Folsom. I love that the trail goes along the American River and stays away from the cars. 

Summer time can get a little hot, into the 100’s at times. But that’s what’s so great about the beach being so close. Another great thing is, you don’t need to pay the parking fee because you’ve already paid the camping fee. 

We’ve only just checked out the lake this year because the years prior, the water levels were well below average. The water at the lake was surprisingly comfortable, and that’s coming from someone who is afraid of the cold.

Next time, I plan to go biking in the morning and then relax and cool off in the lake the rest of the day.
