One of my all time favorite backpacking locations is the Wildcat campsite at Point Reyes. You're practically camping on the water with the beach a stone's throw away. I also highly recommend this campsite to all my newbie friends who want to start backpacking but don't know where to go. 

I visited in July 2018. Getting a weekend permit online is not the easiest. But I remember there was a person who went in for a walk-up and got a spot for one night. 

We started at the Bear Valley Visitor Center to get our permits. There, you can also get a fire permit that can be used on the beach. 

Start at the Bear Valley Trailhead, which is right next to the Visitor Center. The hike down to Wildcat is about 5.5 miles. Watch out, there was a patch of mosquitoes where I’m pretty sure I got bit a few times.

You can see all the campsites from above. You will pass the vaulted toilets that are available and very clean. There is also drinking water right next to the restroom, so you don't have to carry liters of water for drinking and cooking. 

Visited the beach. Played some slap jack (I won). Cooked some yummy food.

This is also a great location for fishing! My partner and his buddy went fishing the whole day while the girls went to explore Alamere Falls, a waterfall that goes straight into the ocean! The falls is only a mile walk down the beach, so it's very easy to get to. Beach is completely desolate because we are miles from the closest parking lot. It’s so quiet and serene.

When we got back, the guys caught 3 fishes! Dinner was served! Not really. But good thing we had our handy fire permit. We were able to start a fire and cook the 3 fishes for dinner. 

We tried to go back the next year, I even got a weekend booking for a group site, but COVID paused our life for a year. Park was closed and we haven’t been back since. One day, I will go back!
