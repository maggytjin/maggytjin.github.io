<p>I've been using a calculator all my life. I never thought about all that goes into a calculator and how complicated it can actually be. The code that goes into not just clearing the screen, but also the memory in the backend. How do you calculate multiple numbers? I thought it would be straight forward, but it took some time and dedication to get it just right. Challenging but rewarding.</p>
