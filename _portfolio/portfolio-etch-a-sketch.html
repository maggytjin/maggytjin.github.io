<p>As a child, I never owned an etch-a-sketch but my friend's did. I was never very creative and patient enough to draw something super cool with just the two knobs. With my coordination, I could never move the knobs in the right direction. But with this online etch-a-sketch, you can draw something in seconds with just your mouse!</p>
